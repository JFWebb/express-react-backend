    "bio": "Hello! I’m a software engineer living in Boston. Throughout my career, I’ve realized that I use a solid balance of left-brain and right-brain thinking. I love opportunities that use both my analytical and artistic skills, which is what I’ve found in both coding and in my previous career as a GIS analyst. I’ve worked in GIS for 3 years, starting with my masters thesis that is now used by state environmental departments all along the east coast. As a GIS analyst, my work involved database management, digital cartography, scripting and designing web applications to bring insights and tools to engineers across New England. While in that role, I started to use coding techniques including REST servers, python, SQL, and database engines on a daily basis. I realized that coding involved that same balance of problem solving and creativity that I loved, and I recently made the switch to pivot to web development full time. I’m currently enrolled in a full time coding program, and I’ve expanded my skill set to Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, React, semantic HTML5, and CSS3. I’m excited by the prospect of combining my previous experience with my growing knowledge base to pursue roles as a full stack engineer."
